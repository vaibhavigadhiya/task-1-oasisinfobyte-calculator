Creating a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves building a user interface with HTML and CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript. 
The user interface should include buttons for numbers, mathematical operators, and a display area for the calculation result.
JavaScript is used to handle user input, perform calculations, and update the display.
The code can be written in a single HTML file or separated into different files for better organization. 
The end result is a functional calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.
